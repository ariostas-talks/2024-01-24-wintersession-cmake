# Wintersession 2024: Introduction to CMake

This repository contains the material used for the CMake workshop at the 2024 Wintersession at Princeton University. The material is based on the [CMake Course](https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage) by the [HEP Software Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) and the [Introduction to Modern CMake book](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/), which is a fantastic resource that you should check out after this workshop.

The live slides can be found [here](https://ariostas.github.io/wintersession2024-cmake).
