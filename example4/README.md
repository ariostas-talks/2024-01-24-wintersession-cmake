# A more realistic example

Now let's look at an extended project that more closely shows how your project should look like. The example was taken from [this book](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/), which is a great resource to learn many more details than what we can cover in this workshop.

Let's go through the project files to see how things are set up.

After taking a look, let's build the package, run the tests and build the docs.

This example uses FetchContent. There are package managers that act as extensions to CMake and provide a lot more functionality. The most popular of these is Conan.
